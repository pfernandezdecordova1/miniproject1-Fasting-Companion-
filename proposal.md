## Instructions 

Your first mini project: build a website for a real person.
Not for yourself. For someone else. A friend, a family member, a club, a local business.
Why? Because real web development starts with understanding what someone else needs.
You can use AI tools, but you must document what you learned from AI-generated code.
I will check your progress in about 2 weeks. Start finding your "client" now.
